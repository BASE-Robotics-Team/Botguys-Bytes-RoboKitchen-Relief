motorfr = port of motor front right 
motorfl = port of motor front left 
motorbr = port of motor back right 
motorbl = port of motor back left 
speed =  desired speed, value of 0-100 is requried 
portarm = port of servo considred the first servo on the robot, typically the servo starting at 0
portarm2 = port of servo considred the second servo on the robot, typically the servo starting at ~1409
second = 1000; value will always be 1000 as there are 1000 miliseconds in a second 
arm_current= current position of the arm  
sevcurrent = current position of first servo
sevcurrent2 = current position of second servo
sevcurrentv = desired starting postion of second servo 
sevhm = desired starting postion of first servo
